Got some shit I want to say
Not sure where I should start at
I will accept all of the blame
Never meant to leave you broken hearted
I wish that we could change
and just go back to when we first started
I hope some day that you'll be ok
When you learn that I have departed

There were lines that got crossed
And shit just got out of hand
So much that we all lost
Things nobody understands
Thought I had it figured out
But found myself in some doubts
There's no going back now
Everything is upside down

I will not be found, no, no, no
I will not be around, no, no, no

There's no going back this time
I think I finally lost my mind
Just want to leave it all behind
And I'll see you in another life
