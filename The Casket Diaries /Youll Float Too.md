# You'll Float Too
---

## Verse 
Girl why you hit my phone
After leaving me alone
What is there say
When there ain't shit you can change
What's done is done
All that love is gone
Made me feel I don't belong
So don't you try and lead me on

## Pre-Chorus
Round and round we go
I tried so hard to let you go
And the second we end up alone
I'm a mess and I lose control

## Chorus
==If you're pennywise, than I must be a ghost
Legend goes that down here we all float
Guess now I know
Tell my brother that he gotta let me go
If you're pennywise, than I must be a ghost
Legend goes that down here we all float
Guess now I know
Tell my brother that he gotta let me go==

## Bridge
I wish you that you could change
But I know you won't
Our fate has been told
And that box will stay closed
If you still care at all
I hope you never let me know

## Chorus
If you're pennywise, than I must be a ghost
Legend goes that down here we all float
Guess now I know
Tell my brother that he gotta let me go
If you're pennywise, than I must be a ghost
Legend goes that down here we all float
Guess now I know
Tell my brother that he gotta let me go

## Bridge II
==As it rains, out the door I go
But not without my yellow coat
Cause down here we all float==
As it rains, out the door I go
But not without my yellow coat
Cause down here we all float
