# Entry I
---

It's hard not to hate. People, things, institutions, when they break your spirit and take pleasure in watching you bleed, hate is the only feeling that makes sense. 

  

But I know what hate does to a man, tears him apart, turns him into something he's not, something he promised himself he'd never become.

  

That's what I need to tell you, to let you know how hard Iâ€™m trying not to cave under the weight of all the awful things I feel in my heart

  

Sometimes my life feels like a deadly balancing act, what I feel slamming up against what I should do, impulsive reactions racing to solutions miles ahead of my brain. 

  

When I look at my day, I realize that most of it was spent cleaning up the damage of the day before. In that life I have no future, all I have is distraction and remorse. 

  

Everyday is a new box, you open it and take a look at what's inside. You're the one who determines if it's a gift or a coffin.
