# You'll Float Too-Alternate Version


Girl why you hit my phone,
After leaving me alone?
What is there say
When there ain't shit or
Anything you can change?

What's done is done
All that love is gone
Made me feel I don't belong
That I was always wrong
When you know that we both at fault 
But I am the wound, you are the salt 

And I was always in the wrong 

Round and round we always go
Tried so hard to let you go
& the second we end up alone
I'm a mess and I lose control

The greatest story never known
But I just want you to know 
Although broken you were my only home
Now I don't know where to go
Don't know how to cope
Find me in the storm drain below
Cause down here we all float 
how to fucking cope
When the pain it grabs ahold 
and my life it starts to choke 
feel like hanging by a rope
I should matter but I don't 
as it rains I go for a stroll
And I grab my yellow coat
And like Georgie I will float
Just Like that paper boat

I wish you that could change
But I know you won't
Our fate is has been told
And that box will stay closed
If you still care at all
I hope you never let me know

Please don't call me anymore
Please don't act like I'm alive
Please forget my fucking face
Please just hate me all the time

It's the only way I can move on
It's our only chance to be happy
So I'll play like I'm dead and gone
So you can finally set us free

as it rains, out the door I go
But not without my yellow coat
Cause down here we all float
Just like that paper boat
The one my brother made
Right before I met my fate

If you're Pennywise, 
than I must be a ghost
Legend goes 
that down here we all float
Guess now I know, 
Tell my brother 
That he gotta let me go

Fucking clown, I hate you now but you already know

Just Like that paper boat
If you're pennywise, than I must be ghost
Cause I found myself trapped down in this hole

You can drag me down a hole
But you won't get my soul
Cause my heart is made of gold
And this story will be told
Stephen king already knows
It's his story I rewrote
