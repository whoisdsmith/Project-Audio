Hey I know right now that you're feeling sad

But everything is dark when you're looking in the past

There's a reason why some things don't last

Please Don't let those thing hold you back

What doesn't kill you makes you still alive

What doesn't love you makes you dead inside

What doesn't miss you never says goodbye

What doesn't help you tends to run and hide

And when things get hard you can't just run and hide

You can't just let it eat you up on the inside

Or it will consume you and your life will pass on by

Keep your head up cause you are enough
