# Life On Repeat

I swear to God my life been on repeat
Every day the same all I feel is defeat
Feels like my feet are planted in the concrete
Only thing that ever changes is my heart beat
Depression got me low
like a down beat

I need a retreat,
I need a cheat sheet
Go back and delete
hours on my time sheet
So I can resync
goin hard like a drum beat
I cant think I can't breathe
Anxiety,
tryna fucking kill me
maybe death is better than being a deadbeat
They got me in the back like a car seat
nobody sees me
I'll be obsolete
left for dead on the side street
With a sign that says free
please take me
A home is all that I need
And maybe then I won't be
So lonely so emprty
Reset me forget me
Don't miss me I'm nothing

But a sad soul
that turned into a ghost
That got lost long ago
Ill stay unknown I just know
As my heartbeat it turns cold
I shiver down to the bones

All that I know
is I can't let go
Of what mattered most
I'm losing control
I Was told
this is death row
I'm gonna die alone

Reset
Forget
Start over again
