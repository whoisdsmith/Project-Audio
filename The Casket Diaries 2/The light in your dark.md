Have you ever lost yourself to somebody you love?

Have you ever felt like you were never enough?

Have you ever been so down staring at that bottle tryna drown?

That was my life then, this is my life now

Cause you see, eventually

you gotta pick up all the pieces

of who you used to be

And put it yourself back together

So you can be better than ever

And I ain't gonna lie

It's gonna take some time

To get yourself back into that right mind

But I promise if you try and try

Everything's gonna be alright

Just take my hand and I'll show you how to get there

I'll light the dark so there's no reason to be scared

Don't give up, don't give up on me now

I will lead you out I promise
