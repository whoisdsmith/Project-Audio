# This Keystone Holiday

This year I have nothing under the tree
Except regrets about the times you had with me
Why the fuck did we even get married?
Just so you could cheat and kill me like the son we buried?

All in all, I wish you well
Like straight down into hell
Back to where you came from
Back to where you belong

I'm sick of writing all these songs
Sick of staying up all night long
Sick of of feeling so damn lost
Wish our paths had never crossed

Dear santa will you grant me this one wish?
Will you drop your sled right on top of this bitch?
I know she's on your naughty list
From all the awful shit she did
I promise that's all I want this Christmas
Please Santa will you grant me this one wish?

(Just stay away from me this year)

(Cause I hate your face more than anything)

(And this year on the holiday)

(I just want you to go away)

(So just stay away)

(I hate your face)

I hope this year that I get (yeah)
everything I’m wanting
Which is you wrapped up in lights
Plugged in and drowning
I know it won’t be my name that you’re calling
But that’s ok cause down to hell you will be falling
