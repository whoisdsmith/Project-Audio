# Entry III
## [[Gravedigger Album]]
---

I am terrified a great deal of the time. Afraid of what I’ve done, of what I’m doing, and of what I might have to do. It’s not a crippling fear. In fact, it’s just the opposite. I thrive on it. I crave it. I need that rush of terror to get me out of bed in the morning.
