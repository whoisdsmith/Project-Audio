# Alive In December
## [[Endings]]

---

Alive in December
It's been 3 years 
And I'm alive in December

Oh she hit me with a text
Always bullshit with this ex
Call me up just for sex
One more reason to regret
I wish we never met
When all I want is to forget

You left me dead back in November
Hole in my chest don't you remember
I tried to put myself back together

It's been 3 years 
and I'm alive in December
