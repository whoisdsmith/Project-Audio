# Let Me Down

Yea every word is truth
Bout everything that I been going through
Every moment feeling blue, 
My thoughts have me consumed 
Fantasize hanging by a noose
My heart can't take anymore abuse
So sick of feeling used by you

Let me down
Lock the door on your way out
Don't come back need solid ground
I need peace need to heal right now

You think I'm sad and pathetic
I think that I need a medic
For the sickness you inflicted
In my mind I can't forget it
You an addict for being dramatic
This time I've had it
Turned my back and you stabbed it
Cause you Savage, causing havic
In everything you do
Every word you fucking say
All the hell you put me through
Doesn't matter what I do
Cause I always seem to lose
And your turned into somebody
That I wish I never knew

Let me down
Lock the door on your way out
Don't come back need solid ground
I need peace need to heal right now

Let me down
Lock the door on your way out
Don't come back need solid ground
I need peace need to heal right now

Let me down
Lock the door on your way out
Don't come back need solid ground
I need peace need to heal right now
