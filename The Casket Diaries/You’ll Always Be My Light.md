# You’ll Always Be My Light
## [[Into The Unknown of The Cosmos]]
---

My father told me do everything with love
To show up every day, give it my best
and to never give up

Dad you made me proud
I sing it loud
that I’m so damn proud
I wonder if you can
hear me now
Up past the clouds
Through the airwaves
Into the heavens now

If you can hear me
I hope you know
Your love was gold
I love the way you shined
With a heart that always glowed

But now I’m...
heartbroken
This sucks and
I miss you
So much and
I know that
you’re never coming
Home again
No, no

Tell me all about your life and what it’s like to be a man
I just think about how you saved my life
when you wore that cape and you wore that smile
And I miss you, I fucking miss you, oh no

It’s not the same without you
I hope you can hear me
I hope you know that
I loved you so deeply

My father told me do everything with love
To show up every day, give it my best
and to never give up

He said “Son, just do your best”

Dad I miss you and I hate that you’re gone
I hope you know I loved you so much
you were the best part of growing up
together you and me had so much fun

I know that you’re in a better place
