So if you leave me babe

I won't die the same

So if you leave me babe

I'll be the one to blame

Verse

I just want my words to matter

To inspire hope and a little laughter

Maybe one day get that happy ever after

For now I’m at the bottom tryna climb the ladder

Been out here on my own

Grinding all alone

Trying to get my shit together

write the perfect flow

I just wanted you to know

That I’m trying to let go

Still trying to find myself

As I’m learning how to grow

And all That pain and sadness

Ain’t ever trying to show

Spent way too many nights

Living like Im on death row

And Now my only goal

turn that sorrow into gold

And Light up the whole room

When I walk in because I glow

I never wanna feel this way again

So low so low so low

Everything good will someday end

Ya know ya know ya know

Verse

Here I go all alone

I’m doing fine all on my own

Don’t need you anymore

just some music and my phone

My hearts grown cold

Cruisin in my fusion

Won’t stop cause I’m not losin

Anymore of myself to anybody else now

Nobody’s gonna let me down again

I won’t lie, or deny

l still think about my wife late at night

and wonder what our life would be like

if she had just fought to try

but it doesn’t even matter

cause the life we had is over

I just hope that she knows

That I always fucking loved her

And no one came before her

Cause I always adored her

but now I must move forward

I was so sad

I was so broken

Wish I could go back

But I was so mad

Over shitty words spoken

Now I leave it in the past

Cause I'm Not taking anymore time

To rewind everything in my life

Cause I’m goin in forward motion

Won’t stop till I get where I'm goin
