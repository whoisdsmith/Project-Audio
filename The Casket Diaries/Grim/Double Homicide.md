# DOUBLE HOMICIDE

---


I feel the reaper taking hold of my bones
Taking me away from all I know
Where the fuck do you think you're going
It's time to be the man you were destined to be

Bitch where the fuck you going now?
I don't even know right now
Doing everything I can
but I can't tell right now

And you don't know me now
and you don't own me anyway
so get the fuck up out my way

I don't want to be who I am meant to be now
I can't take anybody's life from them
I'm not the reaper that you think I am
