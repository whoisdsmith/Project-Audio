# Abomination 

---


Day of the wreckoning  
One for remembering  
Fear will be spread  
When they begin to mention me

Silence be deafening  
No need for questioning  
Death will be prominent  
Right after the sentencing

I am the Reaper  
I will be known  
I am relentless  
Wherever I go

You cannot hide in the light  
Even if you have your god by your side  
The darkness is present when I have arrived  
And I will not stop till you dead in my sights

I am the reaper,
I am the reaper,
I am the reaper,
