# Deaths Anthem
---


I'm growing colder with each and every day
I'm growing colder with each and every day

Now look out
as they scream and shout
Morbid sounds
coming from the underground
where I am found
I was hell bound
Tried to be held down
by the devil's dog pound
Be he soon found
I made em into hell hounds

And made the earth my playground
Can you hear me now
as I call out
I am the cloud
that causes you to drown
In your self doubt
Turn you gangstas into clowns
in your own town

Better fucking watch your mouth
Before I fucking rip that tongue right out

Ay yo reap
Take a seat
And slow the fuck down
You can't just take the hearse
And make the Earth your playground
We had a deal so don't disregard it now

It's still my body
Not your body
So Stop being so cocky
Dont make me karate
Your ass outta me
Like a sodomy
Fucked up lobotomy
not buying what your sellin me
Fuck your policy
I'll be the star
You can call me astronomy

I question every day
If I made a mistake
Maybe there's a better way
I dunno, Guess it's all the same
Cause I chose this fate
And we both know that its too late
for change

I hate being filled with hate
I go irate I fill up with rage
When I see your face
I increase in heart rate
I drown in heart ache
And you're to blame
For every fucking thing
You fuckin fake
And I'll put you in your place
It's a date
Checkmate
