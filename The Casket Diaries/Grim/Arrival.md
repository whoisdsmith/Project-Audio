# ARRIVAL
---

REAPER!
REAPER!
REAPER!

Ok now listen, gotta get this out my system
say what I need to say, is it too late?
Is it too late. is it too late before 
Im lost to the darkness now

Before I descend I break and I bend 
over and over again heart out my chest left me a mess
I need my friends, where are you now
no where to die but you left me to drown

REAPER!
REAPER!
REAPER!
