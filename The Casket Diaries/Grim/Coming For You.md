# Coming For You

---

The reaper is coming,
Coming for you
Coming for you

The reaper is coming,
Coming for you
Coming for you

The reaper is coming,
Coming for you
Coming for you

The reaper is coming,
Yeah, see you
See you soon

My childhood was full of wonder and love
My parents loved me and showed me I was enough
Even when times got tough
we stood up and we fought
for the things we were taught
about kindness and love

And talked about god yeah
Above and how we rotate
around the sun yeah

Everything was going fine, yeah yeah
til I was 35 and lost my wife, overnight to my best mate Ty

And this is how it all began
When all they did was laugh
As I turned and I ran
because Something like this
Has never fucking happened
And I still dont understand

I was found in the gutter of a small little suburb
By my little brother who won't let me suffer
In the cold of the winter sometime in mid December
I was so fucked up I can't remember, remember,
