# I Can't Stay Here

---


Somewhere deep within me (yea) I know
There's a fire burning in my soul
It's what drives me the most``

Some days it's hard to see my self worth
Depression got me hostage in a hearse
Been that way since birth, am I cursed?

I can't stay here, stay here
Trapped inside my worst fears
The darkness is trying
To make all my light disappear
And I don't want to be here, be here. Oh no

I can't stay here, stay here
Trapped inside my worst fears
The darkness is trying
To make all my light disappear
And I don't want to be here, be here. Oh no

Somewhere deep within me (yea) I hold
The key to let all of my fears go
And stop giving them control
  
I just need to light the way back home
Even if it means being alone
I need to be on my own
 
I can't stay here, stay here
I'm getting rid of my fears
The darkness, it won't take me
When my light reappears

I will find my light
I'll take back my life
I will be your guide
When you get lost inside

I can't stay here, stay here
I'm getting rid of my fears
The darkness, it won't take me
When my light reappears

I will find my light
I'll take back my life
I will be your guide
When you get lost inside

There is a light
I can see it my sights
I know the darkness
Isnâ€™t very far behind
