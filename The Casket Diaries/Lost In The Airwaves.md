# Lost In The Airwaves
## [[Endings]]

Where do I go from here
I'm lost and on my own
When all is said and done
I've never felt more alone

Alone, alone, alone

Remember that time when you hit me up
Said you were so in love
I was everything you ever wanted
Now I'm just not enough

Told you one day I would marry you
Make all your dreams come true
Guess that I couldn't come through
Cause you found yourself with somebody new
