# Growing Pains
## [[Into The Unknown of The Cosmos Album]]
---

Long days and long nights,
A million ways to fail
But this time I'mma get it right
Been down, counted out
Left for dead
I won't feel sorry for myself

Body pains and headaches
Got nothing on heartbreak
Breathe in and breathe out
Listen as I sing out loud

Hit the reset and I don't know where I'm goin
Too much time in my mind and I know it
I can't move forward without you letting go and
If you care that isn't fair please never show it

I'm falling apart
this shit is so hard
Got a broken heart
Left it in your yard
Drove to the bar
Just to crash my car
So I can restart
Anywhere you aren’t

I'm falling apart
this shit is so hard
Got a broken heart
Left it in your yard
Drove to the bar
Just to crash my car
So I can restart
Anywhere you aren’t

What doesn't kill you makes you still alive
What doesn't love you makes you dead inside
What doesn't miss you isn't worth your time
What doesn't help you isn't good for your life

Hey I know right now that you're feeling sad
But everything is dark when you look in the past
There's a reason why some things they do not last
Please do not let those things be what we hold you back

Now I can begin
To live again
With no more stress
Cause This is the end
We can't be friends
It won't make sense
In my defense
We were never meant

Long days and long nights,
A million ways to fail
But this time I'mma get it right
Been down, counted out
Left for dead
I won't feel sorry for myself

Body pains and headaches
Got nothing on heartbreak
Breathe in and breathe out
Listen as I sing out loud
