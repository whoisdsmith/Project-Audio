# Reaper

---


[[Gravedigger]] , [[Lifetaker]]
Bet you never thought you’d see my face again
[[Betrayer]], [[Backstabber]]
This time there’s only one way it ends

Stabbed me in the back
With my own knife
Dug me a grave
Left me buried inside
Stabbed me in the back
With my own knife
Dug me a grave
Left me buried inside

I'll never forget what you did to me
You Put that knife into my back 
and than buried me
I told you when you closed that casket
That I'd be back and look where I am at
Oh the Reaper is coming for you
Don’t you know  

End up in the grave
Where you belong 
I promise one day
Me and you gonna come face to face
And we’ll end this shit the right way
The only way that I can find
Some peace in my mind  

I’ll end this shit
The right way 
The only way that I can find
Some peace in my mind

Right way
Yea the, the right way
Ends with you in the grave
Better live now while you can 

I told you when you closed that casket
That I would be back and 
now look where I am at and
I'll never forget what you did to me

You Put that knife into my back and than buried me
I told you when you closed that casket
That I'd be back and now look where I am at and

Oh no aiming down the barrel at your mother fucking face I know

I'll never forget what you did to me
You Put that knife into my back 
and than buried me
I told you when you closed that casket
That I'd be back and now look where I am at and

I'll never forget what you did to me
You Put that knife into my back 
and than buried me
I told you when you closed that casket
That I'd be back and now look where I am at
