# Gravedigger
## [[Gravedigger Album]]
---

I still go back to that day
Back to that night
When you took everything
My whole life, mother fucker

You're lucky I didn't blast
your fucking ass right there
As you watched me move out of my house
You sat your ass in my chair

On the porch
As me and Travis loaded up his car
I never knew this could be so hard
Having your heart torn apart

By another man
walking up into your home
Acting like he owns that shit
before you even go
And the next thing that you know
You ain't got a place to fuckin go
Cause that home ain't you home!

You've been thrown out in the cold
That person you loved is no longer yours to hold
And never in your life have you ever felt so alone
And on your own
As you struggle to survive
when all you really want is just to really fucking die
Cause now the only thing you have
is all this fuckin time
and all you ever do is keep
tryin to talk to god to ask him why?

Gravedigger
Life Taker
Bet you never thought you’d see my face again
Betrayer
Backstabber
This time there’s only one way this ends

I remember that look on his face
When he knew he had taken my place
Taken my life
Taken my wife
And everything that was mine
And he smiled so wide

Stabbed me in the back
With my own knife
Dug me a grave
Left me buried inside

Gravedigger
Life Taker
Bet you never thought you’d see my face again
Betrayer
Backstabber
This time there’s only one way this ends
Gravedigger
Life Taker
Bet you never thought you’d see my face again
Betrayer
Backstabber
This time there’s only one way this ends
