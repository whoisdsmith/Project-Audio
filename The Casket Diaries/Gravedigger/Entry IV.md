# Entry IV
## [[Gravedigger Album]]
---

When we take action to avenge the ones we love, personal justice collides with social and divine justice. We become judge, jury and god. With that choice comes daunting responsibility. Some men cave under that weight, others abuse the momentum. The true outlaw finds the balance between the passion in his heart and the reason in his mind.
