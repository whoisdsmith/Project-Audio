# Take My Hand
## [[Into The Unknown of The Cosmos]]
---

Have you ever lost yourself to somebody you love?
Have you ever felt like you were never enough
Have you ever been so down staring at that bottle tryna drown?
That was my life then, this is my life now

Cause you see, eventually
you gotta pick up all the pieces
Of who you used to be
And put it yourself back together
So you can be better than ever
And I ain't gonna lie
It's gonna take some time
To get yourself back into that right mind
But I promise if you try and try
Everything's gonna be alright

Just take my hand and I'll show you how to get there
I'll light the dark so there's no reason to be scared
Don't give up, don't give up on me now
I will lead you out, I promise
