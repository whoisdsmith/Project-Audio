I think see a light up in front of me

Could it be from me, am I glowing? Am I glowing?

I find it hard to believe that I'm worth anything more than nothing, oh no

And lately I've been feeling all this weight up in my brain and I need to get away but I can't ever get away and I just know that I'm struggling yeah I'm struggling I need to move on with my life cuz it's crumbling

everyday is just the same and I've been trying to get away but I can't ever get away cause nothing ever seems to change and Im tired of the chase I need a change of pace and a break from the heartache

And I don't know where I'm supposed to go

Now that I am on my own

Can somebody guide me in the right direction?

It's time to let the light absorb me

So I can see through the darkness in me

I know I can be the light, I just need some time

It's time to let the light absorb me

So I can see through the darkness in me

I know I can be the light, I just need some time

And lately I've been feeling all this weight up in my brain and I just need to get away but I can't ever get away and I just know that I'm struggling yeah I'm struggling I need to move on with my life cuz it's crumbling

everyday is just the same and I've been trying to get away but I can't ever get away cause nothing ever seems to change and Im tired of the chase I need a change of pace and a break from the heartache
