# Rebirth
## [[Endings]]
---

I just want my words to matter
To inspire hope and a little laughter
Maybe one day get that happy ever after
For now I'm at the bottom tryna climb the ladder

Been out here on my own
Grinding all alone
Trying to get my shit together
write the perfect flow
I just wanted you to know
That I'm trying to let go
Still trying to find myself
As I'm learning how to grow
And all That pain and sadness
Ain't ever trying to show
Spent way too many nights
Living like Im on death row
And Now my only goal
turn that sorrow into gold
And Light up the whole room
When I walk in because I glow

I never wanna feel this way again
So low so low so low
Everything good will someday end
Ya know ya know ya know

Here I go all alone
I'm doing fine all on my own
Don't need you anymore
Just some music and my phone
My hearts grown cold

Cruisin in my fusion
Won't stop cause I'm not losin
Anymore of myself to anybody else now
Nobody's gonna let me down again

I won't lie, or deny
l still think about my wife late at night
And wonder what our life would be like
If she had just fought to try
But it doesn't even matter
Cause the life we had is over
I just hope that she knows
That I always fucking loved her
And no one came before her
Cause I always adored her
But now I must move forward

I was so sad
I was so broken
Wish I could go back

But I was so mad
Over shitty words spoken
Now I leave it in the past

Cause I'm Not taking anymore time
Just to rewind all the shitty things in my life
Cause I'm goin in forward motion
Won't stop till I get where I'm goin
