# The Light Wont Reach You
## [[Into The Unknown of The Cosmos]]
---

I'm sorry that
I couldn't save you
I tried my best
but my light won't reach you
I would have stayed
And been lost with you
But you locked me out
And let the darkness take you``

I'm sorry that
I couldn't save you
I tried my best
but my light won't reach you
I would have stayed
And been lost with you
But you locked me out
And let the darkness take you``
