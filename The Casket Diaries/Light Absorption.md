# Light Absorption
## [[Into The Unknown of The Cosmos]]
---

I think see a light up in front of me
Could it be from me, am I glowing? Am I glowing?
I find it hard to believe that I'm worth anything more than nothing, oh no``

And lately I've been feeling all this weight up in my brain
And I need to get away but I can't ever get away
And I just know that I'm struggling
Yeah I'm struggling
I need to move on with my life cuz it's crumbling``

Everyday is just the same
And I've been trying to get away
But I can't ever get away
Cause nothing ever seems to change
And Im tired of the chase
I need a change of pace and a break from the heartache``

And I don't know where I'm supposed to go
Now that I am on my own
Can somebody guide me in the right direction?``

It's time to let the light absorb me
So I can see through the darkness in me
I know I can be the light, I just need some time
It's time to let the light absorb me
So I can see through the darkness in me
I know I can be the light, I just need some time``

And lately I've been feeling all this weight up in my brain
And I need to get away but I can't ever get away
And I just know that I'm struggling
Yeah I'm struggling
I need to move on with my life cuz it's crumbling``

Everyday is just the same
And I've been trying to get away
But I can't ever get away
Cause nothing ever seems to change
And Im tired of the chase
I need a change of pace and a break from the heartache``
