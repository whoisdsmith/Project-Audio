Straight out the fucking grave I came
I told your ass that I'd be back again for you
someday
And Now their ain't a good damn thing that you can ever say or ever change
Cause the king of death came all this fucking way
Just to make sure your end is filled with pain

  
And what a shame
you cannot die every day
You are such a waste
your mom made a mistake
yea You nothing but a fuckin fake
Who will be erased without a trace
Now take my place in that grave
And what a shame
you cannot die every day
You are such a waste
your mom made a mistake
yea You nothing but a fuckin fake
Who will be erased without a trace
Now take my place in that grave

I'll never forget what you did to me
You Put that knife into my back and than buried me
I told you when you closed that casket
That I'd be back and now look where I am at and
I'll never forget what you did to me
You Put that knife into my back and than buried me
I told you when you closed that casket
That I'd be back and now look where I am at


I just don't get it
so pathetic
Wont forget it
won't regret it
It's poetic
Fuckin epic
I will not be
Sympathetic
And No need for a medic
Cause It's a fetish
That Got me feeling energetic
Like I'm full of meth and
you guessed it
Im obsessed
With your death
You don't get it
And I won't stop
Until I get it

  

You can run but you can't hide
Promise you that I will catch up in time
You can run and you can hide
Promise you that I will catch up

  
It's a death trap
everywhere that I'm at
Everywhere you go
you know that I will follow

  
You can run but you can't hide
I'm a catch up and it's gon be the end of you
End of you

I'll never forget what you did to me
You Put that knife into my back and than buried me
I told you when you closed that casket
That I'd be back and now look where I am at and
I'll never forget what you did to me
You Put that knife into my back and than buried me
I told you when you closed that casket
That I'd be back and now look where I am at


Cuz I'm not dead
But you're dead
Ill do anything to
get you out my head  
I'm a cut you head to toe
And send your soul
straight down to hell
