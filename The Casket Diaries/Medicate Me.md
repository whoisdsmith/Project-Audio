# Medicate Me
## [[Endings]]


---

My thoughts have got me fucked up,
Can't get my mind to shut off
Dr. please just give me some drugs
Medicate me til I go numb

Hard to accept what we've become
Maybe I'll sleep and won't wake up

I don't know how to let you go
For so long you've been all I know
You and I were supposed to grow old
If you're not mine I'd rather die alone

Please don't wake me up
I don't ever want to wake up
To know that I'm stuck
here all alone and
you out there somewhere
Don't even know where

I know I can't go on like this

All I do is fucking miss that life
Miss your smile, miss the way when we were together

My thoughts have got me fucked up,
Can't get my mind to shut off
Dr. please just give me some drugs
Medicate me til I go numb

Hard to accept what we've become
Maybe I'll sleep and won't wake up

I don't know how to let you go
For so long you've been all I know
You and I were supposed to grow old
If you're not mine I'd rather die alone
