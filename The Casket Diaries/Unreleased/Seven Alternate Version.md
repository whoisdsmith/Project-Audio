# Seven-Alternate Version
## [[Unreleased]]

---


It's been 7 years to the day
When your mom she called me
To tell me your heart stopped beating
I felt my chest sink to my gut
And in that moment the whole world stopped
And I ran out the door before that phone could hit the floor,

I thought if I kept running, running, running
I could build enough momentum,
to travel back in time and rewrite your life
just like the flash and I will bring you back
and when I arrived I saw your mother's eyes and I knew that it was too late

And that I failed you I'm sorry
Told your mom not to worry
That he would be alright
And everything will turn out fine
I guess I'm a liar now
As we buried you in the ground
In that tiny little casket
Where the fucks our God now

I thought that after you were gone,
Me and your mom we'd hold on
and stay strong
you were are closest bond
but I was wrong cause see your mom
she blamed me for so long
Said it was all my fault, all my fault
And she would never let it go
Oh Im sorry Stevie
But I can't carry that weight any longer
Any longer
Im sorry I let you down
Sorry that I made you drown
That was never my intention
Im not perfect, no Im not perfect
But I never meant to take
Our first born son away
Never meant to make you feel this way
Never meant to make you feel so much pain
Oh God its been so hard,
living without you here
Seems like its an eternity
But its been Seven years
Since we buried you

she breaks my fucking heart every time she puts that on me
And says it was my fault cause I made her leave for three days cause all she did was yell at me and it was all misunderstanding and I called my best friend cause I just needed some perspective and now she blames her too like it was me just a game to me and you, I'm sorry I dragged you in this Kristin,
cause I kicked her out for three days when she was being

pulled us together but it just toreus apart when she thought of you
We spent the next 5 years recovering, I think your mom still blames me, says that my mistakes caused you to feel pain and I think maybe you tried to escape cause you already knew our fate

And I ran faster than I ever ran cause maybe if I ran fast enough I could go through time and bring him back again
I kept

The world stopped turning
Confusion burning I was
