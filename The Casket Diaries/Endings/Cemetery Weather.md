# Cemetery Weather
## [[Endings]]

---

Here to stay? I wish you were
Now you get away and leave me broken
Oh so broken.

All I ever wanted was this family with you
Why'd you have to fucking do this
Cause I'm dying inside

Every time you do this,
I die a little more each time
I'm waking up and lie awake
or I'm dying in my sleep

I can't breathe

Hold me until the morning passes
Tell me that it will be alright
Want me just for one more day
Until the sun comes up and then you're on your way

Hoping that I was enough
Yet knowing that I'm not strong enough just to get away

Man I'm fucking feeling tired of feeling all this pain

Hold me, tell me that you need me
Lying every fucking time when you leave me
Man I'm so fucking sick to my stomach Yeah my stomach

Should have known better than to ever let you back in my heart
Should have known better than to ever let you tear me apart
But I know that you won't let this go till you're done and used me yeah you used me

So you lead me here once again,
I'm broken

Words you never say,
man I'm crashing up this party
Feeling like I'm rolling in the wind till I'm dying Bitch you better fucking do all the things you want, cause I let this go once, but I'll never let it happen ever again

And I'm running away from you baby
Telling myself that I'm not crazy
All you ever fucking did was blame me
But now it's time for us to end
