# Ending
## [[Endings]]

---

I don't know where to go
all I know is that I'm losing control of my soul
and I don't want to lose myself anymore to you

All this time that I spent
wondering where you have been
I wasted all my time
just to watch you give yourself to someone else
yeah I know that I'm not perfect
but I had given everything I could to you
and look what you did
yeah you took my heart
pulled it straight out of my chest
and I don't know where to fucking go
I'm honestly broken
and I can't be saved
words left on replay
they're cutting right through me now

And some days
I don't know what I'm to believe
cuz everything you told me is exactly what I wanted to hear from you

when you open your mouth
you drown me out

But this isnt anything new,
anything new oh no
all these nights alone
feeling so low
so cold waiting by the phone
but you don't ever answer me
no, no

And I wish that I could take all my time back,
wish you hadn't ended things like that, things like that.
All these days are the same
and I just try to get away
but shit just stays the same and
I don't want to go back now
I don't want to go back
just leave me here to die this time

These days I don't know what to believe
you tell me that I still mean nothing
I don't believe that it's true
I just think what you're going through
is something you can't handle
you don't need me there
but you say I don't matter
cuz it ain't even fair
all this time I've tried
just to get you out my mind

What's the word mean
when you say "forever" to me?
Yeah was it all worth it
was he worth it?
cuz you got me feeling
so damn worthless
Yea oh feeling so alone
got my heart turning cold
and I'm feeling so cold
turn my heart into stone
you know I don't deserve this
