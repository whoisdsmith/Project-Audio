# Return to Sender
## [[Endings]]

---

Yeah it's hard to wake
Hard to face
All of my past mistakes
all this weight
From yesterday
I can no longer carry
My heart you buried.
Grave stone found in the cemetery
So hateful
Gotta stay low
With a plate full
You ungrateful
You the Same hoe

Friend now a foe
Hard to let go
Some shits just hard to swallow
But I will not follow
You down to the hollows
Cause your soul it swallows

And I just want to get out
So sick of all the bullshit
I think I found my way out
I Left you in your bullshit

And I don't want you to drown
But you chose this for yourself now
