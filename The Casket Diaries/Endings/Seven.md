# Seven
## [[Endings]]

It's been 7 years to the day
When your mom she called me
To tell me your heart stopped beating
I felt my chest sink to my gut
And in that moment the whole world stopped
And I ran out the door before that phone could hit the floor

I thought if I kept running, running, running
I could build enough momentum,
to travel back in time and rewrite your life
just like the flash and I will bring you back
and when I arrived I saw your mother's eyes and I knew that it was too late

And that I failed you I'm sorry
Told your mom not to worry
That he would be alright
And everything will turn out fine
I guess I'm a liar now
As we buried you in the ground
In that tiny little casket
Where the fucks our God now

I thought that after you were gone,
Me and your mom we'd hold on and stay strong you were what made us strong  you were are closest bond but I was wrong cause see your mom she blames me, she breaks my fucking heart every time she puts that on me
And says it was my fault cause I made her leave for three days cause all she did was yell at me and it was all misunderstanding and I called my best friend cause I just needed some perspective and now she blames her too like it was me just a game to me and you, I'm sorry I dragged you in this Kristin,
cause I kicked her out for three days when she was being

pulled us together but it just toreus apart when she thought of you
We spent the next 5 years recovering, I think your mom still blames me, says that my mistakes caused you to feel pain and I think maybe you tried to escape cause you already knew our fate

And I ran faster than I ever ran cause maybe if I ran fast enough I could go through time and bring him back again
I kept

The world stopped turning
Confusion burning I was
