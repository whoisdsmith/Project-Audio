# No Redemption

---

Lately I've been wandering
Aimlessly around on my own
It's dark and cold
Nobody's home
I hate being alone

There's no where to go
Nobody calling on my phone
Loneliness cuts right through me to the bone

Hello God are you there
Do you even still care
I know this shit ain't fair
I only pray when no one's here
I know it's not your fault
I never listen when you talk
I only miss things when they're gone
I know now that I'm wrong

Please guide me in the right direction
I swear this will be my last confession
Please save me from my depression
Cause right now all I want is to end it
Please guide me in the right direction
I swear this will be my last confession
Please save me from my depression
Cause right now all I want is to end it
