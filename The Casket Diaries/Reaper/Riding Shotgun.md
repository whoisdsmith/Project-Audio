# RIDING SHOTGUN

---

I just wanted to say that I am sorry
For all the times I hurt you
I hope you know I never meant to 
No, no

I got this darkness trapped inside of me
And I thought that I was in control
till I realized I was in the passenger seat
And the reaper was running the show

Oh no I'm not in control
Of my mind and body anymore
Oh no here we fucking go though
As the reaper makes his way into my soul
