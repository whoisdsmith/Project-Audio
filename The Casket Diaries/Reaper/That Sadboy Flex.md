# That Sadboy Flex

Another day I'm trapped inside  
This hell of mine I made in my mind  
Now that your gone I feel so numb  
Don't give a fuck cause I'm not enough  

What the fuck am I doing here  
All I see is darkness everywhere  

Tell me where to go  
When I don't have a home  
And Im feeling so alone  
nobody even knows  
But that's how the story goes  
I lost what mattered most  
Tie this noose around my throat  
I think it's time that I let go  
Tell me where to go  
When I don't have a home  
And Im feeling so alone  
nobody even knows  
But that's how the story goes  
I lost what mattered most  
Tie this noose around my throat  
I think it's time that I let go
