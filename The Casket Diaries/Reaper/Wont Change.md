# Back in the Day

Back in the day  
Had so much to say  
To that beautiful face  
It was a steady pace  
It Wasn't a race  
there wasn't a chase  
No worries about anyone  
takin my place  
but times they have changed  

Now I'm a disgrace  
Somebody that you now  
try and erase  
But you can't escape  
How you became fake  
Chose him over me  
Now I am replaced  
By someone who wont  
love you the same  
That's what you get  
I was never to blame  
Your love was a game  
I never wanted to play  

Cause I got played  
And that's not okay  

fuck what you say  
Your words full of hate  
Now it i's too late  
You chose your fate  
I hope that you stay  
Forever away.  
That would be great  
I'll say it again  
Stay the fuck away  

Ill try but I cannot lie
all these words up in my brain
they wont ever die
no, I know its all the same
and I know that you wont change
Ill try but I cannot lie
all these words up in my brain
they wont ever die
no, I know its all the same
and I know that you wont change
