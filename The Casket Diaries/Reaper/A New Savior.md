# A New Savior

---

Dear God,
I think i've had enough
this planet is doomed
and I'm giving up
I'm sorry but there's
no one that I can trust
and lately I find myself not caring
and not giving a fuck

Maybe it's just me
and I've gone crazy
My thoughts get loud
I scream and I shout
But you don't ever hear me now
Maybe I'm just changing
into somebody
That I'm already hating
my life is yours for the taking
Oh please God
I'm tired of waiting

I pray that you'll save me
I pray that you hear me
I pray till I fall asleep
why aren't you listening?
I pray that you'll save me
I pray that you hear me
I pray till I fall asleep
why aren't you listening?

I guess maybe it's true
what they say
That you lost hope
And walked away
I guess maybe
there is no hope
and there's only one
other thing I know
that can take me
where I want to go
walking through the shadows
at night all alone

Hey REAP
can you hear me?
I can't sleep
I'm in too deep
and I think
maybe if I sink
I can bring you
here with me
Hey REAP
can you hear me?
I can't sleep
I'm in too deep
and I think
maybe if I sink
I can bring you
here with me

See you soon
