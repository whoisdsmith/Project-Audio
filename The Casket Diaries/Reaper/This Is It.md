# This Is It

---

Fuck this might be the last time that I write  
So imma do my best to make shit right  
I been a fuck up I've been so fucked up  
I just wanna give it up cause I've had enough

Whered the love go, I don't know  
where's the trust at I don't know  
Whered the love go, feelin low  
Where's the trust at I don't know

This is it, just forget, I exist  
gonna miss, All the shit that I did (yeah)  
Fuck him he's a prick (yeah)  
Guess that's what you get and  
Karma's a bitch (yeah)  
We both know this
