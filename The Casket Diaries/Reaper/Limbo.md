Lost my heart to the darkness
Guess that's why I'm heartless
My vessel now a rotting carcass
Stuck between hell and our apartment
Lost my heart to the darkness
Guess that's why I'm heartless
My vessel now a rotting carcass
Stuck between hell and our apartment

Memories on repeat as I drown in defeat
And I can't speak what your name meant to me
Memories on repeat as I drown in defeat
And I can't speak what your name meant to me

All along
was I wrong
Is this
Somewhere I belong
I am lost
Dead and gone
Was it really
worth the cost
All along
was I wrong
Is this
Somewhere I belong
I am lost
Dead and gone
Was it really
worth the cost
