# I Am The Reaper

---

I don't remember who I was back then
Before the darkness came and never left
Cause who I am now is worse than death
I am the cold air that shivers from your breath
The reason your eyes glow red
When you're angry and upset up
I won't let you forget
I am your biggest regrets
I am your silhouette
When the darkness
comes to collect
On all your unpaid debt

I am the reaper
you just don't know it yet

And somewhere along the way
I lost myself to all the hate
And all the pain
I turned it all into
Everything I became

I am the reaper
you just don't know it yet
