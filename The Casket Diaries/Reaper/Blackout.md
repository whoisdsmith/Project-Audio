# BLACKOUT

---


The reaper feeds off your pain
The same way you crave that novacaine
Can you hear the silence in the air
As he gets closer and fills you with fear

Now you finding out
Your time has all run out
So say goodbye to your life
There's no going back now

Breathe that last breath out
As your chest opens now
Look him in the eyes as you die
You outta time

Your body lays there lifeless
Hope you left without regrets

Shouting out loud
Where we go now
Lost the way out
I don't know how
To find the way out
Of this god damn house

The reaper pulls me back down
Under ground as I black out
