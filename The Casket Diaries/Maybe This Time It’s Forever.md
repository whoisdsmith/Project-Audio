# Maybe This Time Itâ€™s Forever
## [[Endings]]

---

Lately I been going crazy
hoping maybe somebody
will come and save me
I know it's wishful thinking

I been stuck inside
this mind of mine
For quite some time
Hoping that I will make it out alive

And where were you
all those fucking times when I needed you?
And where were you
when I was down and out
you were nowhere to be found?

Find me half dead, laying in the gutter
Nothing left, I'm homeless in November
If I meant something, I guess I don't remember
I'm all alone and on my own I guess forever
Find me half dead, laying in the gutter
Nothing left, I'm homeless in November
If I meant something, I guess I don't remember
I'm all alone and on my own I guess forever
  
Losing hope, Let me go
Lost my home, I'm letting go

Find me half dead, laying in the gutter
Nothing left, I'm homeless in November
Am I really someone who won't be remembered?
As I fall asleep maybe this time it's forever

Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on
