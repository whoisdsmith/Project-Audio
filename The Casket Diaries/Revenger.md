# Revenger
## [[Gravedigger Album]]
---

In the dead of the night
breathe in and out 
As I come back to life
With open eyes
I realize 
I’m in this casket 
Where I died

I see you’re home
I am a ghost
Creepin through your window

Hey mother fucker
Did you think that I’d forget?
Did you really think 
You’d get away with it 

 Well guess what? 
You’re fucked
This time 
you’re gonna die
By my hand

I got this blade 
With your name on it
I’ve got some pain
You’re gonna feel it

Back to hell
Where you belong
Mother Fucker 
I promise you
This time it is on

 In the dead of night
I come alive
I am the [[Reaper]] 
You’re gonna die

I’ve got this blade 
With your name on it
I’ve got some pain
And you’re gonna feel it

You took your knife
And stabbed me In the back
You took my whats mine, 
You took my home
And everything I owned and
You smiled so wide
As you watched me die
But that’s alright 
Cause now you’re running out of time
