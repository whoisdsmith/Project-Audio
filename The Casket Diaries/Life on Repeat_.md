``I swear to God my life been on repeat
Every day the same all I feel is defeat
Feels like my feet are planted in the concrete
Only thing that ever changes is my heart beat
Depression got me low like a down beat``

``I need a retreat
I need a cheat sheet
Go back and delete
Hours on my time sheet
So I can resync
Goin hard like a drum beat``

``I cant think I can't breathe
Anxiety, tryna fucking kill me
Maybe death is better than being a deadbeat
They got me in the back like a car seat
Nobody sees me
I'll be obsolete
Left for dead on the side street``

``With a sign that says free
Please take me
A home is all that I need
And maybe then I won't be
So lonely so emprty
Reset me forget me
Don't miss me I'm nothing``

``But a sad soul
That turned into a ghost
That got lost long ago
I'll stay unknown I just know
As my heartbeat it turns cold
I shiver down to the bones``

``All that I know
Is I can't let go
Of what mattered most
I'm losing control
And I Was told
This is death row
And I'm gonna die alone``
